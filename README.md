# NoiseMapper

NoiseMapper, is a cell phone app that not only detects real-time noise levels around us, but also shares this data to the public, creating a noise pollution map. It serves as a tool for communities and for governments to inform policy-making and regulatory efforts. 

NoiseMapper's essential features include measuring noise level, tracking the time and location of each noise measurement, sharing this data with the public, and pinpointing these locations on a global map.
